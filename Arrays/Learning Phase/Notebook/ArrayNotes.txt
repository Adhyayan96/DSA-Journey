1. An array has always fixed size, we can't change (While on the other hand, ArrayList has no fixed size - we can add , delete, update)

2. Printing the output (int datatype) as an array, ex :
		Int a = 3;
		Int b = 4;
		return new int[] {a,b}; 
        Or
        Sout (.......);


3. If we are asked - tell no. of pairs possible in an array :
        the formula is : (n*(n-1))/2  = here n = length of the array

4. If we are asked - tell no. of subarrays(Subarrays = a continuous/contiguous part of an array) possible in an array :
        the formula is : (n*(n+1))/2  = here n = length of the array

5. For every datatype there are maximum and minimum value, those can be accessed by these two methods :
        (1) like for integer values, for minimum (-infinity) : Integer.MIN_VALUE; 
        (2) like for integer values, for maximum (+infinity) : Integer.MAX_VALUE;

6. Arrays to String Conversion :   Arrays.toString(arr);
