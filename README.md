# DSA-Journey
This repository contains solutions to all the problems I solved during my DSA learning journey, organized by topic and difficulty level. It also includes the notes I made during learning in the "Learning Phase/Codes with Concepts" folder, organized topic-wise.

For additional notes from future practice or upsolving, I maintain text files in the "Notebook" folder.

## Topics covered :
1. 1D Arrays
2. Basic Sorting
